# Grind Enchantments

[![build](https://github.com/mschae23/grind-enchantments/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mschae23/grind-enchantments/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Put an enchanted item and a book into a grindstone to put the enchantments onto the book using a few of your levels. You will get the unenchanted item back.

This mod is for Fabric.
